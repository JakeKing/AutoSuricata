AutoSuricata
============

Suricata-IDS install script to automate (or simplify) deployments for Ubuntu. Now with added Sensu Checks for Suricata!

I was well aware of the AutoSnort project built by @da667 that simplified the installation process of Snort super well and decided to build my own deployment script for Suricata to learn a little more about scripting, automation and deployment.

In the early stages this will be fairly simple, however I'd like to add some of the functionality that AutoSnort has, so some of this script will reference those scripts.

You can find out about AutoSnort here: https://github.com/da667/Autosnort/
